                <p><img class="image-me" src="https://via.placeholder.com/250x150">Hey, my name is Barry. I'm an aspiring
                    web developer living in Cary, NC and currently learning new things every day through the UNC-Chapel Hill Coding Boot Camp.
                    Prior to this, I have done some hobbyist game development and wanted to turn my hobby into a career that's both
                    in demand and allows for creativity.
                </p>
                <p>I've always enjoyed technology, and since I can remember I've always enjoyed creating things. Circumstances finally
                    lined up in a way to allow me to pursue a career combining the two, something that has been in the back
                    of my head for nearly my entire adult life.
                </p>
                <p>I live with my wife, Hailey, our two cats, Walter and Paul, and our dog, Dobby. We enjoy watching good movies, eating
                    good food, and having good laughs.
                </p>
